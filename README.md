# DriveFlix

A side project.

Turns your OneDrive or Google Drive account into a personal streaming server.
Integrated torrent client to download videos on the fly directly to your account.
Basically, the app does all the dirty work of organizing a personal torrented
library of videos. It provides functionality that you would get with a fully
fledged streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. For example, you get 'resume
watching', cover art, and a nice organized interface that works on mobile or
desktop clients.

Nothing is implemented yet, I am learning about software architecture, in
particular microservices, and I will be developing the DriveFlix project as part
of the learning process.

After some research on the topic, I will do some smaller projects (like
HumbleBundleScraper) and then I'll dive into this mother.

Look for some software that will allow you to search for torrents. Either you will have to use the API of the torrenting website, or you can check out some third party software that allows you to search and download movies.

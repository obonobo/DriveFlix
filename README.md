# DriveFlix
A side project. Turns your OneDrive or Google Drive account into a personal streaming server. Integrated torrent client to download videos on the fly directly to your account. Basically, the app does all the dirty work of organizing a personal torrented library of videos. It provides functionality that you would get with a fully fledged streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. For example, you get 'resume watching', cover art (pulled from the internet), and a nice organized interface that works on mobile or desktop clients. I would like to make a mobile client too.

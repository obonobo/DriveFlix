A side project. 

Turns your OneDrive or Google Drive account into a personal streaming server. Integrated torrent client to download videos on the fly directly to your account. Basically, the app does all the dirty work of organizing a personal torrented library of videos. It provides functionality that you would get with a fully fledged streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. For example, you get 'resume watching', cover art (pulled from the internet), and a nice organized interface that works on mobile or desktop clients. I would like to make a mobile client too.

Look for some software that will allow you to search for torrents. Either you will have to use the API of the torrenting website, or you can check out some third party software that allows you to search and download movies.

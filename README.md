A side project. 

Turns your OneDrive or Google Drive account into a personal streaming server. Integrated torrent client to download videos on the fly directly to your account. Basically, the app does all the dirty work of organizing a personal torrented library of videos. It provides functionality that you would get with a fully fledged streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. For example, you get 'resume watching', cover art, and a nice organized interface that works on mobile or desktop clients.
